								<h1>Object-oriented Programming</h1>

								<p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of thinking about and organizing code for maximum reusability.<br />
									With this type of programming, a program comprises objects that can interact with the user, other objects, or other programs.This makes programs more efficient and easier to understand.</p>

										<h2>Procedural Programming</h2>
									</header>
									<p>A procedural programming language is based on the concept of procedure calls. It uses a series of steps and procedures to make up a program. The functionality of the program is achieved as a result of calling statements and functions in order. There are limitations associated with procedural programming, namely that the code is not often reusable, and is unable to be plugged in if needed in another application. The same programming code may therefore need to be written many times for the different incarnations in which it is being used. Specific to our interests, a further limitation of procedural programming is that it is difficult to relate it to real-world objects. Associated with this, procedural code does not support encapsulation and inheritance, as two major benefits of object-oriented code. </p>

												<h3>Component-Based Programming</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Component-based programming creates software by joining together sections of code which are already available. The new software provides the capability to join them, in addition to any new functionality. The calls between components enables them to work alongside one another. On its own, an individual component may not achieve much functionality, and needs to rely on the complementarity of other components. Within component-based development, a developer does not need to be concerned with the inner workings of each component, and rather only the ways by which they can be plugged together. </p>

												<h3>Service-Oriented Software</h3>
											</header>
											<p>Service-oriented software is complementary to object-oriented code. With service-oriented, a service must be defined as opposed to an object. A service is defined at a high level, then an object will be developed before, finally, the object can be mapped to the service.</p>

												<h3>Why Object-Oriented</h3>
											</header>
											<p>There is a lot of focus given to object-oriented development today. Writing code in this way is considered to be more supportive of
												developers, with the paradigm of considering real-life objects to which data and methods can be assigned. There are other
												advantages of object-oriented development too, which include shorter methods than those in other software types in addition to
												public and private properties. This makes it possible to manage complexity of the code. With a private property, which can only be
												accessed from within the same class, if anything goes wrong, the culprit can be more easily identified. It also has a positive
												influence on the coupling across the system â€“ coupling describes the interdependency between modules in the system. Low
												coupling is the goal. With private properties, coupling exists only within the class in which the properties exist.
												A modular approach supports distribution of the code development process between developers, in addition to code reuse
												between different applications. OO code is also more easily maintainable than other coding practices, due to the fact that the code
												base is centralised. It can even be argued that object-oriented code is more sustainable, in the sense of being environmentally
												conscious through its modularity, shorter length, and easier maintenance.</p>
